Checkers that learn how to play better over time

I am currently trying to set up the actual checkers game

This is a very ambitious project for my current level of experience, but i hope to learn a lot on the way.  Chances are it wont be pretty, but I do hope that once i make a working version 1, I will be able to later make a better version 2, and maybe 3.

Original tic-tac-toe game I based one possible board is from a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuYg_D_ppYk&t=115s
This is the main one I am currently working on.  It may be under the branch "tkInter".
